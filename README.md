# Capstone-Frontend

My Capstone project, I want to create a multiplayer chess game. I love chess, but most of the online chess websites don't have a great UI. I think it will be too complex
to make the AI chess player, but I want to make it online for 2 people to play against each other.

I want to have a page or two that shows history of chess etc. that display my frontend skills, and a smooth move system that is validated properly by the backend.
